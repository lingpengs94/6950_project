\section{Overview and the goal}\label{overview-and-the-goal}}

In this project, we aim to explore the contributing factors of market
values for the players in the five most successful football leagues in
Europe (i.e., ``Big Five'') in the setting of FIFA 21. FIFA 21, as part
of the FIFA series, is an association football simulation video game,
which is developed and released annually by Electronic Arts under the EA
Sports label. It is the 28th installment in the FIFA series, and was
released on 9 October 2020 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch,
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Enhanced versions for the PlayStation 5 and
Xbox Series X and Series S were released on 3 December 2020, in addition
to a version for Stadia in March 2021. With an official license from
FIFA, the world governing body of football, the game provides
comprehensive data featuring more than 30 official leagues, over 700
clubs, and over 17,000 players.

The `Big Five' represents the five most successful football leagues in
Europe, which are made up of the Premier League in England, La Liga in
Spain, the Bundesliga in Germany, Serie A in Italy and Ligue 1 in
France. Since 1955, the first edition of the European Cup took place
during the 1955--56 season, which provided an unique competition
opportunity for football clubs in Europe. In 1960, the association
coefficient was introduced to rank the football associations in Europe,
and thus determine the number of clubs from an association that will
participate in the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League and the
UEFA Europa Conference League. Since then, the Premier League, La Liga,
the Bundesliga, and Serie A have won the majority of the titles, which
was more than titles won by other associations combined. Though Ligue 1
in France has never won the title, it has been ranked among the top 5
ever since. The combined revenue of these five leagues, which each
represents the highest tier football division in their countries, has
more than doubled in the past decade, reaching a total of approximately
15.1 billion euros in 2019/20. As such, the `Big Five' is consistently
attracting talent players to joint the leagues.

In this study, we aim to examine the contributing factors of market
values for the players, which could potentially provide some insights of
the key strategy in ability training for players to increase their
market value. In addition, the analyses could examine the disparities in
the market value across player's position and the optimal league they
should join to maximize their market value.

(EDA)}\label{exploratory-data-analysis-eda}}

\subsection{Data cleaning}\label{data-cleaning}}

The data set ``players\_21.csv'' contains 106 variables and 18,944
observations. Since our goal is to analyze contribution factors of
players value in ``Big Five'', we only keep the players in ``Spain
Primera Division'', ``Italian Serie A'', ``German 1. Bundesliga'',
``French Ligue 1'' and ``English Premier League''. What's more, goal
keepers are removed due to the different attributes between them and
other players. Finally, 1 player with NA ratings and 2 players with zero
overall scores are removed.

As for the variables, a total of 50 unrelated variables are dropped such
as ``player name'', ``nationality'', ``player tags''. In addition, we
only keep one overall rate for per attribute; thus, 40 variables
measuring specific dimensions of each attribute were removed due to
highly correlation to one another.

After that, 2,756 observations and 16 variables (4 categorical variables
and 12 continuous variables) are left demonstrating the demographic
information (sofifa\_id, name, age, league\_name, weight, height),
individual attribute ratings (overall, pace, shooting, passing,
dribbling, defending, physic), team position and the value in Euro.

\hypertarget{data-manipulation}{%
\subsection{Data manipulation}\label{data-manipulation}}

There are 28 levels in ``team position'' variable, to make it more
interpretable in the model, we group them into 3 categories: Defender,
Midfielder, Forward.

From empirical knowledge, height and weight are always related to each
other, in order to reduce collinearity, we create BMI to combine their
information into one variable.

According to the density plot (\texttt{Figure\ 1}) of the response
(value in Euro), the original data is heavily right skewed, while the
distribution after log-transformation is more likely to Normal. Thus,
log transformed value in Euro is chosen to be the response.

The \texttt{Figure\ 2} presents the distribution of individual
continuous variables, scatterplots and correlation between variables,
which give us a general idea how continuous variables are related to
each other. Shooting, passing, and dribbling are related and they might
reflect the similar aspects of player.

From the plot matrix (\texttt{Figure\ 2}), the distributions of all
continuous variables are roughly Normal. The overall scores and
log-value in Euro are highly correlated (0.972), suggesting that overall
scores is a very important predictors. Besides, the correlation between
passing and dribbling is over 0.8, indicating that there might be some
potential collinearity.

From the box plots of categorical variables (\texttt{Figure\ 3}), the
distributions for preferred foot and league name are quite symmetric
with similar variances, while the variance for forward level in team
position is a slightly larger than others.
